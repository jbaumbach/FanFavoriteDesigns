    <p>Joseph, looking for something different than the same old cookie dough or scratch-off cards for your athletics' related fundraiser?&nbsp;
    Raise money for your fundraiser as well as represent your favorite players with our new, completely custom jersey stickers!</p>
    
    <p>Stickers are available in 5 major sports themes (baseball/softball, football, basketball, hockey, and soccer).&nbsp; They're produced 
    from 5-year exterior life vinyl and are about 5 1/2" x 5 1/2" (depending on design).&nbsp; Also included are detailed application instructions.</p>

    <p>Perfect for:</p>
    <ul>
        
        <li>Little League Sports</li>
        <li>High-School and College Teams</li>
        <li>Recreational Leagues</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Customization Options</h2>
    
    <p>You can customize any of the stickers (at no extra cost), or get them all the same.&nbsp; They feature any name of your 
    choice (up to 13 characters) and any 
    number (up to 2 digits).&nbsp; Typically you will use the name of the team with the year such as "Warriors 08", or 
    individual players' name/nickname with their number.</p>
    
    <p>Here are some examples (you can click to go to our website and preview 
    any custom sticker):</p>
