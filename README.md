==================

This company made white vinyl window stickers of your favorite sports hero.  The sticker was in the outline of a jersey, like a hockey jersey, with a name and number.  So, this.

The stickers are made with a vinyl cutting machine (I used Roland Stika SV-8s) and passing it a plotter file.  The plotter file tells the cutting machine how to cut out the sticker.  The trick is creating the plotter file cheaply.  By hand, it would take a really long time to create a sticker for every player in the NHL, NBA, NFL, and MLB leagues.  Also, each custom sticker would have to be drawn by hand as well.

The solution, of course, is a software application!  That's why you're here, right? This program was written in 2001, and it automates all these things:

* Scrape the data for all the players in the pro and college leagues from the web
* Save it in a database
* Export all the listings (with a picture) to an ebay-compatible data file
* Sending the plotter file to the cutting machine
* Printing shipping labels
